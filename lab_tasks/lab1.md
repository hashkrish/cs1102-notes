## ES Lab 1 Activities

### 1.1 **Creating Directory Structure:**

```
project/
├── directory1/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
├── directory2/
│   ├── file3.txt
│   └── file4.txt
├── original_file.txt
├── hardlink_to_file1.txt
└── softlink_to_file2.txt
```

- Perform the operations listed in the file.

#### **Vi Editor Operations**

> Welcome to the world of vi!

Vi is a powerful text editor that comes pre-installed on most Unix-based systems. It's a modal editor, which means it has different modes for inserting text, navigating, and performing various operations.

Below are some basic operations you can perform in vi:

1. **Opening and Saving Files:**

   - `vi filename`: Open a file.
   - `:wq`: Save changes and exit.
   - `:q!`: Exit without saving.

2. **Navigation:**

   - Arrow keys or `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`.
   - `0` (zero) to jump to beginning of line.
   - `$` to jump to end of line.
   - `:<line_number>` to jump to a specific line.

3. **Editing:**

   - `i` to insert before cursor.
   - `a` to append text after cursor.
   - `x` to delete characters.
   - `dd` to delete a whole line.

4. **Copying, Cutting, and Pasting:**

   - `yy` to copy a line.
   - `dd` to cut a line.
   - `p` to paste below current line, `P` to paste above.

5. **Search and Replace:**

   - `:%s/regex/replacement/g` for global search and replace.
   - `/regex` to search forward, `?regex` to search backward.

6. **Buffers and Windows**

In vi, you can also work with multiple buffers and windows to manage your editing environment more effectively.

Difference between buffer and window: - A buffer is the in-memory text of a file. - A window is a viewport on a buffer.

Here are some basic operations:

- **Buffers:**

  - `:ls` to list buffers.
  - `:b <buffer_number>` to switch buffers.
  - `:bd` to delete a buffer.
  - `:bn` to go to the next buffer.
  - `:bp` to go to the previous buffer.

- **Windows:**

  - `:sp` to split window horizontally.
  - `:vsp` to split window vertically.
  - `Ctrl+w w` to switch between windows.
  - `Ctrl+w q` to close a window.
  - `Ctrl+w r` to rotate windows.
  - `Ctrl+w =` to make all windows equal size.
  - `Ctrl+w -` to decrease window height.
  - `Ctrl+w +` to increase window height.
  - `Ctrl+w <` to decrease window width.
  - `Ctrl+w >` to increase window width.

7. **Help**:

   - Access help: Press `Esc` to ensure you're in command mode, then type `:help` and press `Enter`.
   - Get help on a command: Press `Esc` to ensure you're in command mode, then type `:help <command>` and press `Enter`.

These are just a few basic operations in vi. It's a vast editor with many more features and commands to explore. Happy editing!
