## **Activities**

### Activity 1

Your TA's have gathered a bunch of scripts in the GitHub portal. Your job is to select any 5 if the scripts are short/simple or select 3 if the scripts are long/evolved and do the following:

1. For each script break it down into individual components and explain what it is doing.
	
2. Based on the information above construct a pseudocode/step-wise workflow.
	
3. List out new commands if any present in the script and find at least 3 use cases of each.
	
4. If you select at least 3 extra scripts it will be counted as a bonus

### Activity 2

Now that you have gone through the above activity, research and come up with 3 bash scripts which will accomplish some of the following. **Write the pseudocode/Steps of your script, Explain component of your script.**

Here's a set of Bash scripts designed for comprehension purposes, covering various concepts commonly used in Bash scripting. 

You can work on questions which may include at least two or more concepts listed below. 

Your TA would explain the task by using one of the script present in the shell script repository they created.

1. **File Management Script**:
   - A script that takes a filename as input and checks if it exists, is readable, writable, or executable.

2. **Data Processing Script**:
   - A script that reads data from a CSV file, performs some calculations or manipulations on the data, and writes the result to another file.

3. **String Manipulation Script**:
   - A script that takes a string as input and performs various string manipulation operations such as substring extraction, search and replace, and string concatenation.

4. **Looping Script**:
   - A script that demonstrates various types of loops in Bash, including for loops, while loops, and until loops, along with examples of loop control statements like break and continue.

5. **Function Script**:
   - A script that defines multiple functions for performing specific tasks and demonstrates how to call those functions from within the script.

6. **Error Handling Script**:
   - A script that includes error handling mechanisms such as checking for errors returned by commands, using exit statuses, and implementing try-catch-like behavior.

7. **File Compression Script**:
   - A script that compresses files in a directory into a single archive using tar and gzip, with options to specify the compression level and include/exclude specific files.

8. **Parallel Processing Script**:
   - A script that demonstrates how to perform parallel processing tasks using Bash, such as running multiple tasks concurrently using background processes and managing their outputs.

9. **Interactive Menu Script**:
   - A script that presents an interactive menu to the user with options to perform various tasks, such as file operations, data processing, or system maintenance.

10. **System Monitoring Script**:
    - A script that collects system information such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network statistics and presents the data in a human-readable format.
