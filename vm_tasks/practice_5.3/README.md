# Week 5 problem 3

A school teaches from first to twelfth standard, each standard has 5 sections named as ` A ` to ` E `. The class room number is represented as standard(as number) followed by the section, for example ` 12E `, ` 3C `, etc..
Each classroom has 40 students. There is a directory for every classroom. All the directories are located inside the directory ` ~/cs1102/practice_5.3 `. There is a file for every student named from 1 to 40 in every classroom directory.

Suddenly the school experienced 40% drop in first and sixth standard so they reduced the number of students in each class room to 32. 

Your task is to remove the extra files in the respective directories, i.e. named from 33 to 40.

Note : Run ` synchro init ` to initialize the directory as you did for ` practice_5.2 `.
